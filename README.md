# Typescript Starter
### A Repo containing starter project for typescript tuned to my liking including

* linting
* nvm config
* tsconfig file
* prettier setup


## Setup
### Install Node.js ###
This requires Node.js to run locally and has been tested with
Node 12

See http://nodejs.org/. Alternatively, use Node Version Manager [(NVM)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
This project contains a `.nvmrc` so a simple `nvm install` will set you up.

### Install Project Dependencies ###
```bash
npm install
```

## Running Tests
This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) for testing

```bash
npm test
```
